</p>
<p>The starting point for any good discussion, meeting, 
</p>
<p>or workshop on business model innovation should 
</p>
<p>be a shared understanding of what a business model 
</p>
<p>actually is. We need a business model concept that 
</p>
<p>everybody understands: one that facilitates descrip-
</p>
<p>tion and discussion. We need to start from the same 
</p>
<p>point and talk about the same thing. The challenge is 
</p>
<p>that the concept must be simple, relevant, and intui-
</p>
<p>tively understandable, while not oversimplifying the 
</p>
<p>complexities of how enterprises function. 
</p>
<p>In the following pages we o&#8486;er a concept that allows 
</p>
<p>you to describe and think through the business model 
</p>
<p>of your organization, your competitors, or any other 
</p>
<p>enterprise. This concept has been applied and tested 
</p>
<p>around the world and is already used in organizations 
</p>
<p>such as IBM, Ericsson, Deloitte, the Public Works and 
</p>
<p>Government Services of Canada, and many more.
</p>
<p>This concept can become a shared language that 
</p>
<p>allows you to easily describe and manipulate business 
</p>
<p>models to create new strategic alternatives. Without 
</p>
<p>such a shared language it is di&#8486;icult to systematically 
</p>
<p>challenge assumptions about one&#8217;s business model 
</p>
<p>and innovate successfully.
</p>
<p>We believe a business model can best be described 
</p>
<p>through nine basic building blocks that show the 
</p>
<p>logic of how a company intends to make money. The 
</p>
<p>nine blocks cover the four main areas of a business: 
</p>
<p>customers, o&#8486;er, infrastructure, and financial viability. 
</p>
<p>The business model is like a blueprint for a strategy 
</p>
<p>to be implemented through organizational structures, 
</p>
<p>processes, and systems.</p>

<p><b>The Customer Segments Building Block defines 
the di&#8486;erent groups of people or organizations an 
enterprise aims to reach and serve
</b>Customers comprise the heart of any business model. Without 
(profitable) customers, no company can survive for long. In order 
to better satisfy customers, a company may group them into  
distinct segments with common needs, common behaviors,  
or other attributes. A business model may define one or several  
large or small Customer Segments. An organization must make  
a conscious decision about which segments to serve and which 
segments to ignore. Once this decision is made, a business model 
can be carefully designed around a strong understanding of  
specific customer needs.
</p>
<p>Customer groups represent separate segments if: 
<i>&#8226;&#9;Their needs require and justify a distinct o&#8486;er
&#8226;&#9;They are reached through di&#8486;erent Distribution Channels
&#8226;&#9;They require di&#8486;erent types of relationships
&#8226;&#9;They have substantially di&#8486;erent profitabilities
&#8226;&#9;They are willing to pay for di&#8486;erent aspects of the o&#8486;er

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>}21
</p>
<p><i>There are di&#8486;erent types of Customer Segments.  
</i></p>
<p><i>Here are some examples:
</i></p>
<p><b>Mass market 
</b></p>
<p>Business models focused on mass markets don&#8217;t 
</p>
<p>distinguish between di&#8486;erent Customer Segments. 
</p>
<p>The Value Propositions, Distribution Channels, and 
</p>
<p>Customer Relationships all focus on one large group  
</p>
<p>of customers with broadly similar needs and problems. 
</p>
<p>This type of business model is often found in the 
</p>
<p>consumer electronics sector. 
</p>
<p><b>Niche market 
</b></p>
<p>Business models targeting niche markets cater to 
</p>
<p>specific, specialized Customer Segments. The Value 
</p>
<p>Propositions, Distribution Channels, and Customer 
</p>
<p>Relationships are all tailored to the specific require-
</p>
<p>ments of a niche market. Such business models 
</p>
<p>are often found in supplier-buyer relationships. For 
</p>
<p>example, many car part manufacturers depend heavily 
</p>
<p>on purchases from major automobile manufacturers. 
</p>
<p><b>Segmented 
</b></p>
<p>Some business models distinguish between market 
</p>
<p>segments with slightly di&#8486;erent needs and problems. 
</p>
<p>The retail arm of a bank like Credit Suisse, for example, 
</p>
<p>may distinguish between a large group of customers, 
</p>
<p>each possessing assets of up to U.S. $100,000, and 
</p>
<p>a smaller group of a&#8486;luent clients, each of whose net 
</p>
<p>worth exceeds U.S. $500,000. Both segments have 
</p>
<p>similar but varying needs and problems. This has 
</p>
<p>implications for the other building blocks of Credit 
</p>
<p>Suisse&#8217;s business model, such as the Value Proposi-
</p>
<p>tion, Distribution Channels, Customer Relationships, 
</p>
<p>and Revenue streams. Consider Micro Precision 
</p>
<p>Systems, which specializes in providing outsourced 
</p>
<p>micromechanical design and manufacturing solutions. 
</p>
<p>It serves three di&#8486;erent Customer Segments &#8212; the 
</p>
<p>watch industry, the medical industry, and the industrial 
</p>
<p>automation sector &#8212; and o&#8486;ers each slightly di&#8486;erent 
</p>
<p>Value Propositions.  
</p>
<p><b>Diversified 
</b></p>
<p>An organization with a diversified customer business 
</p>
<p>model serves two unrelated Customer Segments 
</p>
<p>with very di&#8486;erent needs and problems. For example, 
</p>
<p>in 2006 Amazon.com decided to diversify its retail 
</p>
<p>business by selling &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; services:  online 
</p>
<p>storage space and on-demand server usage. Thus 
</p>
<p>it started catering to a totally di&#8486;erent Customer 
</p>
<p>Segment &#8212; Web companies &#8212; with a totally di&#8486;erent 
</p>
<p>Value Proposition. The strategic rationale behind this 
</p>
<p>diversification can be found in Amazon.com&#8217;s powerful 
</p>
<p>IT infrastructure, which can be shared by its retail sales 
</p>
<p>operations and the new cloud computing service unit.
</p>
<p><b>Multi-sided platforms (or multi-sided markets)
</b></p>
<p>Some organizations serve two or more interdepen-
</p>
<p>dent Customer Segments. A credit card company, for 
</p>
<p>example, needs a large base of credit card holders  
</p>
<p>and a large base of merchants who accept those credit 
</p>
<p>cards. Similarly, an enterprise o&#8486;ering a free news-
</p>
<p>paper needs a large reader base to attract advertisers. 
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it also needs advertisers to finance 
</p>
<p>production and distribution. Both segments are 
</p>
<p>required to make the business model work (read  
</p>
<p>more about multi-sided platforms on p. 76).
</p>
<p>For whom are we creating value?
Who are our most important customers?</p>

</p>
<p><b>The Value Propositions Building Block describes 
the bundle of products and services that create 
value for a specific Customer Segment
</b>The Value Proposition is the reason why customers turn to one 
company over another. It solves a customer problem or satisfies 
a customer need. Each Value Proposition consists of a selected 
bundle of products and/or services that caters to the requirements 
of a specific Customer Segment. In this sense, the Value Proposi-
tion is an aggregation, or bundle, of benefits that a company  
o&#8486;ers customers.
 Some Value Propositions may be innovative and represent a 
new or disruptive o&#8486;er. Others may be similar to existing market 
o&#8486;ers, but with added features and attributes.

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>}23
</p>
<p><i>A Value Proposition creates value for a Customer 
</i></p>
<p><i>Segment through a distinct mix of elements cater-
</i></p>
<p><i>ing to that segment&#8217;s needs. Values may be quan-
</i></p>
<p><i>titative (e.g. price, speed of service) or qualitative 
</i></p>
<p><i>(e.g. design, customer experience). 
</i></p>
<p><i> Elements from the following non-exhaustive list 
</i></p>
<p><i>can contribute to customer value creation.
</i></p>
<p><b>Newness
</b></p>
<p>Some Value Propositions satisfy an entirely new set 
</p>
<p>of needs that customers previously didn&#8217;t perceive 
</p>
<p>because there was no similar o&#8486;ering. This is often, 
</p>
<p>but not always, technology related. Cell phones, 
</p>
<p>for instance, created a whole new industry around 
</p>
<p>mobile telecommunication. On the other hand, 
</p>
<p>products such as ethical investment funds have 
</p>
<p>little to do with new technology.
</p>
<p><b>Performance 
</b></p>
<p>Improving product or service performance has 
</p>
<p>traditionally been a common way to create value. 
</p>
<p>The PC sector has traditionally relied on this factor 
</p>
<p>by bringing more powerful machines to market. 
</p>
<p>But improved performance has its limits. In recent 
</p>
<p>years, for example, faster PCs, more disk storage 
</p>
<p>space, and better graphics have failed to produce 
</p>
<p>corresponding growth in customer demand. 
</p>
<p>What value do we deliver to the customer?  
Which one of our customer&#8217;s problems are we helping  
to solve? Which customer needs are we satisfying?  
What bundles of products and services are we o&#8486;ering  
to each Customer Segment?
</p>
<p><b>Customization
</b></p>
<p>Tailoring products and services to the specific  
</p>
<p>needs of individual customers or Customer  
</p>
<p>Segments creates value. In recent years, the 
</p>
<p>concepts of mass customization and customer 
</p>
<p>co-creation have gained importance. This approach 
</p>
<p>allows for customized products and services,  
</p>
<p>while still taking advantage of economies of scale. </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>} 24
</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Getting the job done&#8221;
</b></p>
<p>Value can be created simply by helping a customer 
</p>
<p>get certain jobs done. Rolls-Royce understands this 
</p>
<p>very well: its airline customers rely entirely on Rolls-
</p>
<p>Royce to manufacture and service their jet engines. 
</p>
<p>This arrangement allows customers to focus on  
</p>
<p>running their airlines. In return, the airlines pay 
</p>
<p>Rolls- Royce a fee for every hour an engine runs. 
</p>
<p><b>Design 
</b></p>
<p>Design is an important but di&#8486;icult element to mea-
</p>
<p>sure. A product may stand out because of superior 
</p>
<p>design. In the fashion and consumer electronics 
</p>
<p>industries, design can be a particularly important 
</p>
<p>part of the Value Proposition. 
</p>
<p><b>Brand/status
</b></p>
<p>Customers may find value in the simple act of using 
</p>
<p>and displaying a specific brand. Wearing a Rolex 
</p>
<p>watch signifies wealth, for example. On the other end 
</p>
<p>of the spectrum, skateboarders may wear the latest 
</p>
<p>&#8220;underground&#8221; brands to show that they are &#8220;in.&#8221;
</p>
<p><b>Price 
</b></p>
<p>O&#8486;ering similar value at a lower price is a common 
</p>
<p>way to satisfy the needs of price-sensitive Cus-
</p>
<p>tomer Segments. But low-price Value Propositions 
</p>
<p>have important implications for the rest of a busi-
</p>
<p>ness model. No frills airlines, such as Southwest, 
</p>
<p>easyJet, and Ryanair have designed entire business 
</p>
<p>models specifically to enable low cost air travel. 
</p>
<p>Another example of a price-based Value Proposi-
</p>
<p>tion can be seen in the Nano, a new car designed 
</p>
<p>and manufactured by the Indian conglomerate Tata. 
</p>
<p>Its surprisingly low price makes the automobile 
</p>
<p>a&#8486;ordable to a whole new segment of the Indian 
</p>
<p>population. Increasingly, free o&#8486;ers are starting to 
</p>
<p>permeate various industries. Free o&#8486;ers range from 
</p>
<p>free newspapers to free e-mail, free mobile phone 
</p>
<p>services, and more (see p. 88 for more on FREE).

</p>
<p><b>Cost reduction
</b></p>
<p>Helping customers reduce costs is an important 
</p>
<p>way to create value. Salesforce.com, for example, 
</p>
<p>sells a hosted Customer Relationship management 
</p>
<p>(CRM) application. This relieves buyers from the 
</p>
<p>expense and trouble of having to buy, install, and 
</p>
<p>manage CRM software themselves.
</p>
<p><b>Risk reduction
</b></p>
<p>Customers value reducing the risks they incur  
</p>
<p>when purchasing products or services. For a used 
</p>
<p>car buyer, a one-year service guarantee reduces  
</p>
<p>the risk of post-purchase breakdowns and repairs.  
</p>
<p>A service-level guarantee partially reduces the 
</p>
<p>risk undertaken by a purchaser of outsourced IT 
</p>
<p>services. 
</p>
<p><b>Accessibility
</b></p>
<p>Making products and services available to custom-
</p>
<p>ers who previously lacked access to them is another 
</p>
<p>way to create value. This can result from business 
</p>
<p>model innovation, new technologies, or a combina-
</p>
<p>tion of both. NetJets, for instance, popularized the 
</p>
<p>concept of fractional private jet ownership. Using an 
</p>
<p>innovative business model, NetJets o&#8486;ers individu-
</p>
<p>als and corporations access to private jets, a service 
</p>
<p>previously una&#8486;ordable to most customers. Mutual 
</p>
<p>funds provide another example of value creation 
</p>
<p>through increased accessibility. This innovative 
</p>
<p>financial product made it possible even for those 
</p>
<p>with modest wealth to build diversified investment 
</p>
<p>portfolios.
</p>
<p><b>Convenience/usability
</b></p>
<p>Making things more convenient or easier to use 
</p>
<p>can create substantial value. With iPod and iTunes, 
</p>
<p>Apple o&#8486;ered customers unprecedented conve-
</p>
<p>nience searching, buying, downloading, and listen-
</p>
<p>ing to digital music. It now dominates the market.</p>

<p><b>The Channels Building Block describes how a  
company communicates with and reaches its  
Customer Segments to deliver a Value Proposition 
</b>Communication, distribution, and sales Channels comprise a 
company's interface with customers. Channels are customer touch 
points that play an important role in the customer experience. 
Channels serve several functions, including:
<i>&#8226;&#9;Raising awareness among customers about a company&#8217;s  
 products and services
&#8226;&#9;Helping customers evaluate a company&#8217;s Value Proposition
&#8226;&#9;Allowing customers to purchase specific products and services
&#8226;&#9;Delivering a Value Proposition to customers
&#8226;&#9;Providing post-purchase customer support

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>}27Through which Channels do our Customer Segments  
want to be reached? How are we reaching them now? 
How are our Channels integrated? Which ones work best? 
Which ones are most cost-e&#8486;icient? How are we  
integrating them with customer routines?
<i>Channels have five distinct phases. Each channel can 
</i></p>
<p><i>cover some or all of these phases. We can distinguish 
</i></p>
<p><i>between direct Channels and indirect ones, as well as 
</i></p>
<p><i>between owned Channels and partner Channels. 
</i></p>
<p>Finding the right mix of Channels to satisfy how 
</p>
<p>customers want to be reached is crucial in bringing 
</p>
<p>a Value Proposition to market. An organization can 
</p>
<p>choose between reaching its customers through its 
</p>
<p>own Channels, through partner Channels, or through 
</p>
<p>a mix of both. Owned Channels can be direct, such as 
</p>
<p>an in-house sales force or a Web site, or they can be 
</p>
<p>indirect, such as retail stores owned or operated by the 
</p>
<p>organization. Partner Channels are indirect and span a 
</p>
<p>whole range of options, such as wholesale distribution, 
</p>
<p>retail, or partner-owned Web sites.
</p>
<p> Partner Channels lead to lower margins, but they 
</p>
<p>allow an organization to expand its reach and benefit 
</p>
<p>from partner strengths. Owned Channels and particu-
</p>
<p>larly direct ones have higher margins, but can be costly 
</p>
<p>to put in place and to operate. The trick is to find the 
</p>
<p>right balance between the di&#8486;erent types of Channels, 
</p>
<p>to integrate them in a way to create a great customer 
</p>
<p>experience, and to maximize revenues.

<p><b>The Customer Relationships Building Block  
describes the types of relationships a company  
establishes with specific Customer Segments 
</b>A company should clarify the type of relationship it wants to 
establish with each Customer Segment. Relationships can range 
from personal to automated. Customer relationships may be 
driven by the following motivations:
<i>&#8226;&#9;Customer acquisition 
&#8226;&#9;Customer retention 
&#8226;&#9;Boosting sales (upselling)
</i></p>
<p><b><i>Customer Relationships</i></b><i></i>4
In the early days, for example, mobile network operator Customer 
Relationships were driven by aggressive acquisition strategies 
involving free mobile phones. When the market became saturated, 
operators switched to focusing on customer retention and increas-
ing average revenue per customer. 
 The Customer Relationships called for by a company&#8217;s business 
model deeply influence the overall customer experience.
</p>
<p><b>CR</b></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>}29
</p>
<p><i>We can distinguish between several categories of 
</i></p>
<p><i>Customer Relationships, which may co-exist in a 
</i></p>
<p><i>company&#8217;s relationship with a particular  
</i></p>
<p><i>Customer Segment:
</i></p>
<p><b>Personal assistance 
</b></p>
<p>This relationship is based on human interaction.  
</p>
<p>The customer can communicate with a real customer 
</p>
<p>representative to get help during the sales process or 
</p>
<p>after the purchase is complete. This may happen on-
</p>
<p>site at the point of sale, through call centers, by e-mail, 
</p>
<p>or through other means. 
</p>
<p><b>Dedicated personal assistance
</b></p>
<p>This relationship involves dedicating a customer 
</p>
<p>representative specifically to an individual client. It 
</p>
<p>represents the deepest and most intimate type of 
</p>
<p>relationship and normally develops over a long period 
</p>
<p>of time. In private banking services, for example, dedi-
</p>
<p>cated bankers serve high net worth individuals. Similar 
</p>
<p>relationships can be found in other businesses in the 
</p>
<p>form of key account managers who maintain personal 
</p>
<p>relationships with important customers. 
</p>
<p><b>Self-service
</b></p>
<p>In this type of relationship, a company maintains no 
</p>
<p>direct relationship with customers. It provides all the 
</p>
<p>necessary means for customers to help themselves. 
</p>
<p><b>Automated services
</b></p>
<p>This type of relationship mixes a more sophisti-
</p>
<p>cated form of customer self-service with automated 
</p>
<p>processes. For example, personal online profiles give 
</p>
<p>customers access to customized services. Automated 
</p>
<p>services can recognize individual customers and their 
</p>
<p>characteristics, and o&#8486;er information related to orders 
</p>
<p>or transactions. At their best, automated services can 
</p>
<p>stimulate a personal relationship (e.g. o&#8486;ering book or 
</p>
<p>movie recommendations). 
</p>
<p><b>Communities
</b></p>
<p>Increasingly, companies are utilizing user communities 
</p>
<p>to become more involved with customers/prospects 
</p>
<p>and to facilitate connections between community 
</p>
<p>members. Many companies maintain online com-
</p>
<p>munities that allow users to exchange knowledge and 
</p>
<p>solve each other&#8217;s problems. Communities can also 
</p>
<p>help companies better understand their customers. 
</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline launched a 
</p>
<p>private online community when it introduced <i>alli</i>, a 
</p>
<p>new prescription-free weight-loss product.  
</p>
<p> GlaxoSmithKline wanted to increase its under-
</p>
<p>standing of the challenges faced by overweight 
</p>
<p>adults, and thereby learn to better manage customer 
</p>
<p>expectations. 
</p>
<p><b>Co-creation
</b></p>
<p>More companies are going beyond the traditional 
</p>
<p>customer-vendor relationship to co-create value with 
</p>
<p>customers. Amazon.com invites customers to write 
</p>
<p>reviews and thus create value for other book lovers. 
</p>
<p>Some companies engage customers to assist with the 
</p>
<p>design of new and innovative products. Others, such 
</p>
<p>as YouTube.com, solicit customers to create content 
</p>
<p>for public consumption.
</p>
<p>What type of relationship does each of our Customer  
Segments expect us to establish and maintain with them? 
Which ones have we established? How costly are they?  
How are they integrated with the rest of our business model?</p>

<b>The Revenue Streams Building Block represents 
the cash a company generates from each Customer 
Segment (costs must be subtracted from revenues to 
create earnings)
</b>If customers comprise the heart of a business model, Revenue 
Streams are its arteries. A company must ask itself, For what value 
is each Customer Segment truly willing to pay? Successfully  
answering that question allows the firm to generate one or more 
Revenue Streams from each Customer Segment. Each Revenue 
Stream may have di&#8486;erent pricing mechanisms, such as fixed list 
prices, bargaining, auctioning, market dependent, volume depen-
dent, or yield management. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Revenue Streams</i></b><i></i>5
A business model can involve two di&#8486;erent types of Revenue Streams:
<i>&#8226;&#9;Transaction revenues resulting from one-time customer payments
&#8226;&#9;Recurring revenues resulting from ongoing payments to either  
 deliver a Value Proposition to customers or provide post-purchase  
 customer support 
</i></p>
<p><b>R$</b></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>}31
</p>
<p><i>There are several ways to generate Revenue Streams: 
</i></p>
<p><b>Asset sale
</b></p>
<p>The most widely understood Revenue Stream derives 
</p>
<p>from selling ownership rights to a physical product. 
</p>
<p>Amazon.com sells books, music, consumer electron-
</p>
<p>ics, and more online. Fiat sells automobiles, which 
</p>
<p>buyers are free to drive, resell, or even destroy. 
</p>
<p><b>Usage fee
</b></p>
<p>This Revenue Stream is generated by the use of a 
</p>
<p>particular service. The more a service is used, the 
</p>
<p>more the customer pays. A telecom operator may 
</p>
<p>charge customers for the number of minutes spent on 
</p>
<p>the phone. A hotel charges customers for the number 
</p>
<p>of nights rooms are used. A package delivery service 
</p>
<p>charges customers for the delivery of a parcel from 
</p>
<p>one location to another.
</p>
<p><b>Subscription fees
</b></p>
<p>This Revenue Stream is generated by selling continu-
</p>
<p>ous access to a service. A gym sells its members 
</p>
<p>monthly or yearly subscriptions in exchange for 
</p>
<p>access to its exercise facilities. World of Warcraft 
</p>
<p>Online, a Web-based computer game, allows users to 
</p>
<p>play its online game in exchange for a monthly sub-
</p>
<p>scription fee. Nokia&#8217;s Comes with Music service gives 
</p>
<p>users access to a music library for a subscription fee. 
</p>
<p><b>Lending/Renting/Leasing
</b></p>
<p>This Revenue Stream is created by temporar-
</p>
<p>ily granting someone the exclusive right to use a 
</p>
<p>particular asset for a fixed period in return for a 
</p>
<p>fee. For the lender this provides the advantage of 
</p>
<p>recurring revenues. Renters or lessees, on the other 
</p>
<p>hand, enjoy the benefits of incurring expenses for 
</p>
<p>only a limited time rather than bearing the full costs 
</p>
<p>For what value are our customers really willing to pay?  
For what do they currently pay? How are they currently 
paying? How would they prefer to pay? How much does 
each Revenue Stream contribute to overall revenues?
</p>
<p>of ownership. Zipcar.com provides a good illustration. 
</p>
<p>The company allows customers to rent cars by the 
</p>
<p>hour in North American cities. Zipcar.com&#8217;s service 
</p>
<p>has led many people to decide to rent rather than 
</p>
<p>purchase automobiles. 
</p>
<p><b>Licensing 
</b></p>
<p>This Revenue Stream is generated by giving customers 
</p>
<p>permission to use protected intellectual property in 
</p>
<p>exchange for licensing fees. Licensing allows rights-
</p>
<p>holders to generate revenues from their property with-
</p>
<p>out having to manufacture a product or commercialize 
</p>
<p>a service. Licensing is common in the media industry, 
</p>
<p>where content owners retain copyright while selling 
</p>
<p>usage licenses to third parties. Similarly, in technology 
</p>
<p>sectors patentholders grant other companies the right 
</p>
<p>to use a patented technology in return for a license fee.</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>} 32
</p>
<p><b>Brokerage fees
</b></p>
<p>This Revenue Stream derives from intermediation 
</p>
<p>services performed on behalf of two or more parties. 
</p>
<p>Credit card providers, for example, earn revenues 
</p>
<p>by taking a percentage of the value of each sales 
</p>
<p>transaction executed between credit card merchants 
</p>
<p>and customers. Brokers and real estate agents earn 
</p>
<p>a commission each time they successfully match a 
</p>
<p>buyer and seller. 
</p>
<p><b>Advertising
</b></p>
<p>This Revenue Stream results from fees for advertising 
</p>
<p>a particular product, service, or brand. Traditionally, 
</p>
<p>the media industry and event organizers relied heavily 
</p>
<p>on revenues from advertising. In recent years other 
</p>
<p>sectors, including software and services, have started 
</p>
<p>relying more heavily on advertising revenues. 
</p>
<p>   
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p><i>Each Revenue Stream might have di&#8486;erent pricing 
</i></p>
<p><i>mechanisms. The type of pricing mechanism chosen 
</i></p>
<p><i>can make a big di&#8486;erence in terms of revenues gener-
</i></p>
<p><i>ated. There are two main types of pricing mechanism: 
</i></p>
<p><i>fixed and dynamic pricing.</i></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>}33
</p>
<p><b>Fixed &#8220;Menu&#8221; Pricing

<b>The Key Resources Building Block describes  
the most important assets required to make a  
business model work  
</b>Every business model requires Key Resources. These resources 
allow an enterprise to create and o&#8486;er a Value Proposition, reach 
markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and  
earn revenues. Di&#8486;erent Key Resources are needed depending on 
the type of business model. A microchip manufacturer requires 
capital-intensive production facilities, whereas a microchip designer 
focuses more on human resources.
 Key resources can be physical, financial, intellectual, or human. 
Key resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired 
from key partners.

<p><b><i>Key Resources</i></b><i></i>6
<b>KR</b></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>}35
</p>
<p><i>Key Resources can be categorized as follows:
</i></p>
<p><b>Physical
</b></p>
<p>This category includes physical assets such as 
</p>
<p>manufacturing facilities, buildings, vehicles, machines, 
</p>
<p>systems, point-of-sales systems, and distribution 
</p>
<p>networks. Retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon.com 
</p>
<p>rely heavily on physical resources, which are often 
</p>
<p>capital-intensive. The former has an enormous global 
</p>
<p>network of stores and related logistics infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>The latter has an extensive IT, warehouse, and logistics 
</p>
<p>infrastructure.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Intellectual 
</b></p>
<p>Intellectual resources such as brands, proprietary 
</p>
<p>knowledge, patents and copyrights, partnerships, 
</p>
<p>and customer databases are increasingly important 
</p>
<p>components of a strong business model. Intellectual 
</p>
<p>resources are di&#8486;icult to develop but when success-
</p>
<p>fully created may o&#8486;er substantial value. Consumer 
</p>
<p>goods companies such as Nike and Sony rely heavily 
</p>
<p>on brand as a Key Resource. Microsoft and SAP 
</p>
<p>depend on software and related intellectual property 
</p>
<p>developed over many years. Qualcomm, a designer 
</p>
<p>and supplier of chipsets for broadband mobile 
</p>
<p>devices, built its business model around patented 
</p>
<p>microchip designs that earn the company substantial 
</p>
<p>licensing fees. 
</p>
<p><b>Human
</b></p>
<p>Every enterprise requires human resources, but 
</p>
<p>people are particularly prominent in certain business 
</p>
<p>models. For example, human resources are crucial in 
</p>
<p>knowledge-intensive and creative industries. A phar-
</p>
<p>maceutical company such as Novartis, for example, 
</p>
<p>relies heavily on human resources: its business model 
</p>
<p>is predicated on an army of experienced scientists 
</p>
<p>and a large and skilled sales force. 
</p>
<p><b>Financial
</b></p>
<p>Some business models call for financial resources  
</p>
<p>and/or financial guarantees, such as cash, lines of 
</p>
<p>credit, or a stock option pool for hiring key employ-
</p>
<p>ees. Ericsson, the telecom manufacturer, provides 
</p>
<p>an example of financial resource leverage within a 
</p>
<p>business model. Ericsson may opt to borrow funds 
</p>
<p>from banks and capital markets, then use a portion of 
</p>
<p>the proceeds to provide vendor financing to equipment 
</p>
<p>customers, thus ensuring that orders are placed with 
</p>
<p>Ericsson rather than competitors.

<p><b>Platform/network
</b></p>
<p>Business models designed with a platform as a Key 
</p>
<p>Resource are dominated by platform or network-
</p>
<p>related Key Activities. Networks, matchmaking 
</p>
<p>platforms, software, and even brands can function as 
</p>
<p>a platform. eBay&#8217;s business model requires that the 
</p>
<p>company continually develop and maintain its plat-
</p>
<p>form: the Web site at eBay.com. Visa&#8217;s business model 
</p>
<p>requires activities related to its Visa&#174; credit card 
</p>
<p>transaction platform for merchants, customers, and 
</p>
<p>banks. Microsoft&#8217;s business model requires managing 
</p>
<p>the interface between other vendors&#8217; software and its 
</p>
<p>Windows&#174; operating system platform. Key Activi-
</p>
<p>ties in this category relate to platform management, 
</p>
<p>service provisioning, and platform promotion.
</p>
<p>What Key Activities do our Value Propositions require?
Our Distribution Channels? Customer Relationships?  
Revenue streams?</p>

<b>The Key Partnerships Building Block describes 
the network of suppliers and partners that make  
the business model work
</b>Companies forge partnerships for many reasons, and partnerships 
are becoming a cornerstone of many business models. Companies 
create alliances to optimize their business models, reduce risk, or 
acquire resources. 
We can distinguish between four di&#8486;erent types of partnerships:
<i>&#8226;&#9;Strategic alliances between non-competitors
&#8226;&#9;Coopetition: strategic partnerships between competitors
&#8226;&#9;Joint ventures to develop new businesses
&#8226;&#9;Buyer-supplier relationships to assure reliable supplies
</i></p>
<p><b><i>Key Partnerships</i></b><i></i>8
<b>KP</b></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>}39
</p>
<p><i>It can be useful to distinguish between three  
</i></p>
<p><i>motivations for creating partnerships:
</i></p>
<p><b>Optimization and economy of scale
</b></p>
<p>The most basic form of partnership or buyer-supplier 
</p>
<p>relationship is designed to optimize the allocation of 
</p>
<p>resources and activities. It is illogical for a company to 
</p>
<p>own all resources or perform every activity by itself. 
</p>
<p>Optimization and economy of scale partnerships are 
</p>
<p>usually formed to reduce costs, and often involve 
</p>
<p>outsourcing or sharing infrastructure. 
</p>
<p><b>Reduction of risk and uncertainty
</b></p>
<p>Partnerships can help reduce risk in a competitive 
</p>
<p>environment characterized by uncertainty. It is not 
</p>
<p>unusual for competitors to form a strategic alliance 
</p>
<p>in one area while competing in another. Blu-ray, for 
</p>
<p>example, is an optical disc format jointly developed  
</p>
<p>by a group of the world&#8217;s leading consumer electron-
</p>
<p>ics, personal computer, and media manufacturers. 
</p>
<p>The group cooperated to bring Blu-ray technology to 
</p>
<p>market, yet individual members compete in selling 
</p>
<p>their own Blu-ray products. 
</p>
<p><b>Acquisition of particular resources and activities
</b></p>
<p>Few companies own all the resources or perform all 
</p>
<p>the activities described by their business models. 
</p>
<p>Rather, they extend their own capabilities by relying  
</p>
<p>on other firms to furnish particular resources or 
</p>
<p>perform certain activities. Such partnerships can be 
</p>
<p>motivated by needs to acquire knowledge, licenses, or 
</p>
<p>access to customers. A mobile phone manufacturer, 
</p>
<p>for example, may license an operating system for its 
</p>
<p>handsets rather than developing one in-house. An 
</p>
<p>insurer may choose to rely on independent brokers to 
</p>
<p>sell its policies rather than develop its own sales force. 
</p>
<p>Who are our Key Partners? Who are our key suppliers? 
Which Key Resources are we acquiring from partners? 
Which Key Activities do partners perform?</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b>The Cost Structure describes all costs incurred to 
operate a business model
</b>This building block describes the most important costs incurred 
while operating under a particular business model. Creating and de-
livering value, maintaining Customer Relationships, and generating 
revenue all incur costs. Such costs can be calculated relatively easily 
after defining Key Resources, Key Activities, and Key Partnerships. 
Some business models, though, are more cost-driven than others. 
So-called &#8220;no frills&#8221; airlines, for instance, have built business models 
entirely around low Cost Structures. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Cost Structure</i></b><i></i>9
<b>CS</b></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>}41
</p>
<p><i>Naturally enough, costs should be minimized in every 
</i></p>
<p><i>business model. But low Cost Structures are more 
</i></p>
<p><i>important to some business models than to others. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Therefore it can be useful to distinguish between two 
</i></p>
<p><i>broad classes of business model Cost Structures:  
</i></p>
<p><i>cost-driven and value-driven (many business models 
</i></p>
<p><i>fall in between these two extremes):
</i></p>
<p><b>Cost-driven
</b></p>
<p>Cost-driven business models focus on minimizing 
</p>
<p>costs wherever possible. This approach aims at  
</p>
<p>creating and maintaining the leanest possible  
</p>
<p>Cost Structure, using low price Value Propositions,  
</p>
<p>maximum automation, and extensive outsourcing.  
</p>
<p>No frills airlines, such as Southwest, easyJet, and 
</p>
<p>Ryanair typify cost-driven business models.
</p>
<p><b>Value-driven
</b></p>
<p>Some companies are less concerned with the cost 
</p>
<p>implications of a particular business model design, 
</p>
<p>and instead focus on value creation. Premium Value 
</p>
<p>Propositions and a high degree of personalized service 
</p>
<p>usually characterize value-driven business models. 
</p>
<p>Luxury hotels, with their lavish facilities and exclusive 
</p>
<p>services, fall into this category. 
</p>
<p><i>Cost Structures can have the following characteristics:
</i></p>
<p><b>Fixed costs
</b></p>
<p>Costs that remain the same despite the volume of 
</p>
<p>goods or services produced. Examples include salaries, 
</p>
<p>rents, and physical manufacturing facilities. Some 
</p>
<p>businesses, such as manufacturing companies, are 
</p>
<p>characterized by a high proportion of fixed costs. 
</p>
<p><b>Variable costs
</b></p>
<p>Costs that vary proportionally with the volume of 
</p>
<p>goods or services produced. Some businesses, such as 
</p>
<p>music festivals, are characterized by a high proportion 
</p>
<p>of variable costs.
</p>
<p><b>Economies of scale
</b></p>
<p>Cost advantages that a business enjoys as its output 
</p>
<p>expands. Larger companies, for instance, benefit from 
</p>
<p>lower bulk purchase rates. This and other factors 
</p>
<p>cause average cost per unit to fall as output rises.
</p>
<p><b>Economies of scope
</b></p>
<p>Cost advantages that a business enjoys due to a larger 
</p>
<p>scope of operations. In a large enterprise, for example, 
</p>
<p>the same marketing activities or Distribution Channels 
</p>
<p>may support multiple products. 
</p>
<p>What are the most important costs inherent in our business 
model? Which Key Resources are most expensive? Which 
Key Activities are most expensive?</p>

<p>In 2001 Apple launched its iconic iPod brand of por-
</p>
<p>table media player. The device works in conjunction 
</p>
<p>with iTunes software that enables users to transfer 
</p>
<p>music and other content from the iPod to a computer. 
</p>
<p>The software also provides a seamless connection 
</p>
<p>to Apple&#8217;s online store so users can purchase and 
</p>
<p>download content. 
</p>
<p>This potent combination of device, software, and 
</p>
<p>online store quickly disrupted the music industry and 
</p>
<p>gave Apple a dominant market position. Yet Apple was 
</p>
<p>not the first company to bring a portable media player 
</p>
<p>to market. Competitors such as Diamond Multimedia, 
</p>
<p>with its Rio brand of portable media players, were suc-
</p>
<p>cessful until they were outpaced by Apple. 
</p>
<p>Example: Apple iPod/iTunes Business Model
</p>
<p>How did Apple achieve such dominance? Because it 
</p>
<p>competed with a better business model. On the one 
</p>
<p>hand it o&#8486;ered users a seamless music experience by 
</p>
<p>combining its distinctively designed iPod devices with 
</p>
<p>iTunes software and the iTunes online store. Apple&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Value Proposition is to allow customers to easily 
</p>
<p>search, buy, and enjoy digital music. On the other hand, 
</p>
<p>to make this Value Proposition possible, Apple had to 
</p>
<p>negotiate deals with all the major record companies to 
</p>
<p>create the world&#8217;s largest online music library. 
</p>
<p>The twist? Apple earns most of its music-related 
</p>
<p>revenues from selling iPods, while using integration 
</p>
<p>with the online music store to protect itself from 
</p>
<p>competitors.</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>This section describes a number of techniques and tools from the world  
of design that can help you design better and more innovative business 
models. A designer&#8217;s business involves relentless inquiry into the best pos-
sible way to create the new, discover the unexplored, or achieve the func-
tional. A designer&#8217;s job is to extend the boundaries of thought, to generate 
new options, and, ultimately, to create value for users. This requires the 
ability to imagine &#8220;that which does not exist.&#8221; We are convinced that the 
tools and attitude of the design profession are prerequisites for success in 
the business model generation. 
</p>
<p>Businesspeople unknowingly practice design every day. We design orga-
nizations, strategies, business models, processes, and projects. To do this, 
we must take into account a complex web of factors, such as competitors, 
technology, the legal environment, and more. Increasingly, we must do so in 
unfamiliar, uncharted territory. This is precisely what design is about. What 
businesspeople lack are design tools that complement their business skills. 
</p>
<p>The following pages explore six business model design techniques:  
Customer Insights, Ideation, Visual Thinking, Prototyping, Storytelling, and 
Scenarios. We introduce each technique with a story, then demonstrate 
how the technique applies to business model design. Here and there we've 
added exercises and suggestions for workshop activities that show you 
specifically how the design technique can be applied. Book references are 
provided at the end for those interested in exploring each technique in 
more depth.

constructively question established business models and strategically 
examine the environment in which your own business model functions.
</p>
<p>The following pages explore four strategic areas: the Business Model 
Environment, Evaluating Business Models, a Business Model Perspective 
on Blue Ocean Strategies, and how to Manage Multiple Business Models 
within an enterprise.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>We hope we&#8217;ve shown you how visionaries, game changers, and  
challengers can tackle the vital issue of business models. We hope  
we&#8217;ve provided you with the language, the tools and techniques, and  
the dynamic approach needed to design innovative and competitive  
new models. But much remains to be said. So here we touch on five  
topics, each of which might well merit its own book. 
</p>
<p>The first examines business models beyond profit: how the Canvas can 
drive business model innovation in the public and non-profit sectors.  
The second suggests how computer-aided business model design might 
leverage the paper-based approach and allow for complex manipulation 
of business model elements. The third discusses the relationship between 
business models and business plans. The fourth addresses issues that 
arise when implementing business models in either new or existing  
organizations. The final topic examines how to better achieve business 
model and IT alignment.</p>

<p> process<i> 
The core team, consisting of Alexander, Yves, and Patrick start the project 
</i></p>
<p><i>with a number of meetings to sketch out the business model of the book. 
</i></p>
<p><i>The Hub is launched to co-create the book with business model innovation 
</i></p>
<p><i>practitioners throughout the world. Creative Director Alan Smith of The 
</i></p>
<p><i>Movement hears about the project and put his company behind it. Finally, 
</i></p>
<p><i>Hub member Tim Clark joins the core team after recognizing the need for an 
</i></p>
<p><i>editor. The group is completed by JAM, a company that uses visual thinking 
</i></p>
<p><i>to solve business problems. An engagement cycle is started to pump fresh 
</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;chunks&#8221; of content out to the Hub community for feedback and contribu-
</i></p>
<p><i>tions. The writing of the book becomes completely transparent. Content, 
</i></p>
<p><i>design, illustrations, and structure are constantly shared and thoroughly com-
</i></p>
<p><i>mented upon by Hub members worldwide. The core team responds to every 
</i></p>
<p><i>comment and integrates the feedback back into the book and design. A &#8220;soft 
</i></p>
<p><i>launch&#8221; of the book is organized in Amsterdam, Netherlands, so members of 
</i></p>
<p><i>the Hub can meet in person and share their experiences with business model 
</i></p>
<p><i>innovation. Sketching out participant business models with JAM becomes the 
</i></p>
<p><i>core exercise of the day. Two hundred special limited edition prototypes of the 
</i></p>
<p><i>(unfinished) book go to print and a video of the writing process is produced 
</i></p>
<p><i>by Fisheye Media. After several more iterations the first print run is produced.
